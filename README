Chicken bindings for Cairo, a vector graphics library
-----------------------------------------------------

Chicken Cairo is licensed under the LGPL. See the
file "COPYING", in this archive.

http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/ - Chicken Scheme compiler

Some things you will need:
 - A current version of cairo: http://cairo.freedesktop.org/
   (Last compiled with HEAD revision 2004-11-09)
 - For the test program, chicken-sdl (including sdl-csi)

Before employing make in the regular fashion, be sure pkg-config can
find your cairo.pc: you may need to

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

You'll also need sdl.so from chicken-sdl handy -- either installed, or
copied into the directory -- for the test program to run.  Try

/path/to/sdl-csi test-cairo.scm

The latest version of chicken-cairo should be available from a
GNU/Arch archive at http://www.eighty-twenty.org/archives/
